# Effective strategies for managing intensive care unit bed capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic

## Abstract
To help mitigate ICU overload during pandemic surges, we propose and evaluate strategies that adjust non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) levels and ICU-bed capacity. Using Korea’s ICU data, we developed an age-structured model incorporating implementation delays and IOR (ICU-occupancy rate) thresholds. Simulation results suggest that to maintain an IOR below 0.8, NPI Level 3 or higher is needed, particularly when a seven-day policy delay exists. If only NPI Level 1 is applied, early intervention—when IOR exceeds 0.6—is required to keep the peak IOR under control. Additionally, a minimum 10% increase in ICU-bed capacity is necessary under delayed responses. Expanding bed capacity at the IOR threshold of 0.6 further supports IOR management. These findings offer practical guidance for ICU resource planning and policy design during health crises

## Code Description
This repository contains the code and data for the paper "Effective strategies for managing intensive care unit bed capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic".

### 1. Data and Parameters Overview

The project relies on specific data and parameters organized as follows:

* **`data/` folder**: This directory contains the input datasets crucial for the simulations.
    * `covid-19 cases & death`: Historical data on COVID-19 cases and deaths.
    * `population`: Population data relevant to the simulation.
    * `vaccine`: Vaccination data.

* **`parameters/` folder**: This directory stores key parameters used in the model.
    * `beta_level`: Transmission rate (beta) values corresponding to different NPI levels.
    * `icu_admission_rate`: Rate of ICU admissions.
    * `severe_case_fatality_rate`: Fatality rate for severe cases.
    * ... (add any other relevant parameters here)

### 2. Scenario Execution

The simulations are executed via scripts located in the `scenario/` folder:

* **`scenario/S1.m`**: This script runs the **NPI scenario** simulations.
* **`scenario/S2.m`**: This script runs the **comprehensive scenario** simulations.

### 3. Results Storage

All simulation outputs and results are saved in the **`result/` folder**.
